# Prefix Search

In MeiliSearch, **the search is possible even with a single letter sent**.

All words starting with this letter are added to the bucket sort and then the other ranking rules are applied.

Since there is so many possible relevant documents with only one letter, the longer the search query is the fastest it will respond.
