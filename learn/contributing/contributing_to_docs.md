# Contributing to our documentation

This documentation website is hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation). It is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.github.io), written in [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Our documentation philosophy

Our documentation aims to be:

- **Efficient**: we don't want to waste anyone's time
- **Accessible**: reading this shouldn't require native English or a computer science degree
- **Thorough**: behavior that isn't documented or is documented incorrectly
- **Open source**: this is a resource by Meilisearch users, for Meilisearch users

## How to contribute?

### Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues/new/choose) are the primary tool the documentation team uses to track tasks. Helpful issues include:

- Bug reports detailing technical issues with this website
- Requests for new features (for example, versioning or an embeded console)
- Requests for new content such as new cookbooks and tutorials

#### Creating your first issue

All you need to create an issue is a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. Log into your account
2. Go to the Meilisearch [Documentation repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation)
3. Click on "Issues"
4. Use the search bar to make sure nobody else has reported your issue already. If somebody has, give them an upvote üëç and **don't create that issue**!
5. Click "New issue"
6. Fill in a short, descriptive title and longer summary of your problem or suggestion. If you're reporting a bug, make sure to include steps to reproduce the error, as well as your OS and browser version
7. Click "Submit new issue"
8. A member of our team should [get back to you](#how-we-review-contributions) shortly
9. Enjoy the feeling of a job well done! üéâ

### Pull requests

You can also help improving the documentation by making a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Pull requests ("PRs" for short) are requests to integrate your changes into a GitHub repository. The simplest way to create a PR on our documentation is by using the **"Edit this page"** link at the bottom left of every page. [See below](#creating-your-first-pr) for more detailed instructions.

Pull requests are particularly good for:

- Fixing a small error, such as a typo or broken link
- Making a change that you are particularly qualified for (such as creating a guide for a tool you have mastered)
- **Solving an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues)**!

In most cases, it is a good idea to [create an issue](#creating-your-first-issue) before making a PR. This allows everyone to clarify the problem you're solving and the best way of addressing it.

#### Creating your first PR

All you need to continue is a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. On the documentation page you'd like to edit, scroll to the bottom and click **"Edit this page"** on the left. This will take you to GitHub
2. If you're not already signed in, do so now. You may be prompted to create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)‚Äîif so, do it
3. Use GitHub's text editor to make the change you want
4. Scroll down to where it says `Propose changes`. In the first text box, write a short description (for example, "Fix typo in search API reference"). In the second text box, fill in the pre-existing template and add any relevant information
5. Click `Propose changes` to continue. You should see a page that says `Comparing changes`. This screen is prompting you to create a pull request
6. Make sure the base repository is `meilisearch/documentation` and the base branch is `main`. Don't worry about the other two boxes‚Äîthey automatically target the changes you just made
7. Below, you can see the changes you made compared to the main branch (what's currently published on docs.meilisearch.com). When you're ready, click `Create pull request`
8. **Congrats, you made your first PR!** Someone from the documentation team will review your pull request shortly. They may ask for changes, so keep an eye on your GitHub notifications
9. If everything looks good, your work will be merged into the `main` branch and become part of the official documentation site. You are now a Meilisearch Contributor! üöÄ

## How we review contributions

For **reviewing issues**, we consider a few criteria:

1. Is this task a priority for the documentation team?
2. Is the documentation website the best place for this information? Sometimes an idea might work better on our blog than the docs, or it might be more effective to link to an external resource than write and maintain it ourselves
3. If it's a bug report, can we reproduce the error?

If users show interest in an issue by upvoting or reporting similar problems, it is more likely the documentation will divert resources towards that task.

For **reviewing contributor PRs**, we start by making sure the PR is up to our **quality standard**.

We ask the following questions:

1. Is the information **accurate**?
2. Is it **easy to understand**? 
3. Are explanations and examples clear?
4. Is the English **clear and concise** Can it be understood by a non-native speaker?
5. Is the grammar perfect? Are there any typos?
6. Can it be **shortened without losing any important information**?
7. Do the suggested changes require updating other pages in the documentation website?
8. In the case of new content, is the article in the right location? Should it be linked elsewhere in the documentation?

Nothing makes us happier than getting a thoughtful, helpful PR that saves us time and effort and makes the documentation **even stronger**. Thank you in advance for your contribution!
