# Features

## Search as you type

Also called "instant search". Results are delivered while you're still inputting your query. Displayed results are changed in real-time whenever you type additional text into the search box.

## Ultra relevant

Meilisearch's default [relevancy rules](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.md) are designed to deliver an intuitive search experience with zero setup. They can be [customized](/reference/api/settings.md#ranking-rules) to ensure perfect results for your dataset.

## Typo tolerant

Instead of letting typos ruin your search experience, Meilisearch will always find the results you expect. Read more about typo tolerance in [this dedicated guide](/learn/configuration/typo_tolerance.md).

## Geosearch

Explore the physical world. [Geosearch](/learn/advanced/geosearch.md) allows you to filter and sort results based on their physical location.

## Filters

Define [filters](/learn/advanced/filtering_and_faceted_search.md) to refine results based on user-defined criteria.

## Faceting

Build intuitive navigation interfaces with [faceted search](/learn/advanced/filtering_and_faceted_search.md).

## Sorting

[Sort search results](/learn/advanced/sorting.md) at query time and let users choose which results they want to see first.

## API key management

[Protect your instance with API keys](/learn/security/master_api_keys.md). Control which users can access what indexes, routes, and endpoints.

## Multitenancy

Manage complex multi-user applications handling sensitive data. [Tenant tokens](/learn/security/tenant_tokens.md) help you decide which documents each one of your users can search.

## Synonyms

[Define synonyms](/learn/configuration/synonyms.md) and craft a tailored, intuitive search experience.

## Highlighting

[Highlight](/reference/api/search.md#attributes-to-highlight) query terms and help users immediately find the matched text in a document.

## Comprehensive language support

[Meilisearch is multilingual](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/language.md)! We aim to support every language represented in our global community.

## Phrase search

[Wrap search terms in double quotes (`"`) for strict queries](/reference/api/search.md#phrase-search) that only return exact matches.

## Index swapping

Deploy major database updates with zero search downtime! Our [index swapping](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md#swapping-indexes) functionality helps you make big changes seamlessly.
