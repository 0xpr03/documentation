# Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes metrics to be scraped by a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) collector at regular intervals and stored for analysis. Teams can monitor this endpoint to gain valuable insight into Meilisearch's behavior and performance. This information can be useful to optimize an application's performance, troubleshoot issues, or improve the overall reliability of a system.
