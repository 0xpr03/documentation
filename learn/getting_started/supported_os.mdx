# Supported operating systems

This page lists operating systems Meilisearch officially supports and tests with every new release. Meilisearch binaries might still run in unsupported environments. Refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases) for more information on operating system support changes.

If the provided [binaries](/learn/getting_started/installation#local-installation) don't work for you, try building Meilisearch from source. If compilation fails, Meilisearch is not compatible with your machine.

## Linux

The Meilisearch binary works on all Linux distributions with `amd64/x86_64` or `aarch64/arm64` architecture using glibc 2.27 and later. You can check your glibc version using:

```
ldd --version
```

## macOS

The Meilisearch binary works with macOS 12 and later with `amd64` or `arm64` architecture.

## Windows

The Meilisearch binary works on Windows Server 2022 and later.

It is likely the Meilisearch binary also works with Windows OS 10 and later. However, due to the differences between Windows OS and Windows Server, Meilisearch does not officially support Windows OS.
