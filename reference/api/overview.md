## Headers

### Recommended headers

#### Content type

Any API request with a payload (`--data-binary`) requires a `Content-Type` header. Meilisearch currently supports the following formats:

- `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON
- `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson` for NDJSON
- `Content-Type: text/csv` for CSV

The only endpoints which currently accept NDJSON and CSV `Content-Type` are the [add documents](/reference/api/documents.md#add-or-replace-documents) and [update documents](/reference/api/documents.md#add-or-update-documents) endpoints. For all others, use `Content-Type: application/json`.

#### Authorization

For almost all routes, you need to be recognized by the server to check your permissions. Add your API key to your headers.

<CodeSamples id="authorization_header_1" />

Please read about [security keys](/learn/security/master_api_keys.md) and [how to manage them](/reference/api/keys.md) for more information.

`Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY`

::: note
 v0.24 and below use the `X-MEILI-API-KEY: apiKey` authorization header.

### Errors

Failed requests are always accompanied by a JSON-formatted error response. Meilisearch errors can be of one of the following types:

| Type              | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `invalid_request` | This is due to an error in the user input. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `4xx`                         |
| `internal`        | This is due to machine or configuration constraints. The most common cause is reaching or exceeding hard limits, such as the size of the disk, the size limit of an index, etc. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `5xx`  |
| `auth`            | This type of error is related to authentication and authorization. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `4xx` |

Response body:

```json
{
  "message": "Index `movies` not found.",
  "code": "index_not_found",
  "type": "invalid_request",
  "link": "https://docs.meilisearch.com/errors#index_not_found"
}
```

If you're having trouble understanding an error, take a look at the [complete list](/reference/api/error_codes.md) of `code` values and descriptions.

## Asynchronous operations

Meilisearch is an **asynchronous API**. This means that in response to most write requests, you will receive a summarized version of the `task` object:

```json
{
    "taskUid": 1,
    "indexUid": "movies",
    "status": "enqueued",
    "type": "indexUpdate",
    "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

You can use this `taskUid` to get more details on [the status of the task](/reference/api/tasks.md#get-one-task).

See more information about [asynchronous operations](/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations.md).
